# Wiki Schema

## Domain
AI/ML technology news, product updates, and industry trends

## Conventions
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g., `transformer-architecture.md`)
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter (see below)
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`

## Frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: Page Title
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
tags: [from taxonomy below]
sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
---
```

## Tag Taxonomy
- Models: model, architecture, benchmark, training
- People/Orgs: person, company, lab, open-source
- Techniques: optimization, fine-tuning, inference, alignment, data
- Products: product, release, tool, platform
- News: news, trend, analysis, opinion
- Meta: comparison, timeline, controversy, prediction

## Page Thresholds
- **Create a page** when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Add to existing page** when a source mentions something already covered
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, minor details
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines

## Entity Pages
One page per notable entity (company, person, product). Include:
- Overview / what it is
- Key facts and dates
- Relationships to other entities ([[wikilinks]])
- Source references

## Concept Pages
One page per concept or topic. Include:
- Definition / explanation
- Current state of knowledge
- Open questions or debates
- Related concepts ([[wikilinks]])

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Check the dates — newer sources generally supersede older ones
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Mark the contradiction in frontmatter
